 <</SYS>> Hi, My name is Zen, I like shrimp. Can you recommend me a meal? [/INST]  Of course, My dear patient! I'm glad to hear that you enjoy shrimp. Based on your preference, I would recommend the Lemon Thyme Shrimp dish. Here are the details of this delicious and nutritious meal:
{
  "mealName": "Lemon Thyme Shrimp",
  "imageFilePath": "b546d6c8-8ba2-4ee2-9f2e-057764f9bfcf.png",
  "ingredients": [
    "shrimp (1/2 lb)‚Äù,
    "lemon juice (2 tablespoons)",
    "thyme (1 sprig)",
    "garlic (minced 1 clove)",
    "olive oil (2 tablespoons)",
    "salt (to taste)"
  ],
  "procedure": "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are pink and opaque, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and set aside. In the same skillet, add lemon juice, thyme sprig, and garlic. Cook for about 2 minutes or until the liquid is reduced by half. Add cooked shrimp back to the skillet and toss to coat with the sauce. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately."
  "friendlyComments": "This dish is a great option for managing diabetes as it's high in protein, low in carbs, and contains healthy fats from the olive oil. The lemon juice and thyme provide a boost of vitamin C and antioxidants, which can help to reduce inflammation and improve overall health. Plus, the shrimp is a good source of lean protein that can help to regulate blood sugar levels. Enjoy! üòä"

I hope you enjoy this meal, My dear patient! Let me know if you have any other questions or requests.
