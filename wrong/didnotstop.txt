The shrimp provides lean protein, while the lemon juice and thyme add flavor without adding extra fat or calories. And, of course, the olive oil is rich in healthy fats that can help manage blood sugar levels. üí° Plus, it's easy to prepare and doesn't require much time or effort! üëç So go ahead and give it a try! How does that sound?",
