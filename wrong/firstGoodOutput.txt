 <</SYS>> Hi, My name is Zen, I like shrimp. Can you recommend me a meal? [/INST]  Of course, I'd be happy to help! Based on your preference for shrimp, I recommend the Lemon Thyme Shrimp dish. Here's why:
{
  "mealName": "Lemon Thyme Shrimp",
  "imageFilePath": "/public/images/b546d6c8-8ba2-4ee2-9f2e-057764f9bfcf.png"
}
This dish is a flavorful and healthy option for diabetic patients like you. The lemons provide a good source of vitamin C, while the thyme adds a boost of antioxidants. The shrimp provides lean protein to help manage blood sugar levels. Plus, it's easy to prepare and can be cooked in just a few minutes.
I hope you enjoy your meal! Let me know if you have any other questions or preferences.
