 hi, my name is Gio, I like chicken, can you recommend me a meal?
 hopefully itâ€™s not too spicy for me.
Hi Gio! I'm happy to help you find a meal that you'll enjoy. There are many delicious and non-spicy options that you might like. How about trying some grilled or baked chicken with a variety of seasonings and sauces? You could also consider chicken dishes that are popular in different cultures, such as General Tso's Chicken (a Chinese dish) or Chimichurri Chicken (an Argentine dish). Let me know if you have any other preferences or dietary restrictions, and I can give you more tailored recommendations.
