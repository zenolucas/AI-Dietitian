"prep_time": "15 min",
"cook_time": "18 min",
"servings": 4,
"ingredients": [
"egg (1)",
"water (1 tbsp)",
"olive oil (2 tsp)",
"whole-wheat panko bread crumbs (1/3 cup)",
"grated Parmesan cheese (1/3 cup)",
"minced fresh parsley (2 tbsp)",
"dried oregano (1/2 tsp)",
"black pepper (1/4 tsp)",
"boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1 lbs, cut into 4 (4-oz) portions and flattened to

1/4-inch thickness)"

],
"directions": [

"Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly spray a 13 × 9 × 2-inch baking dish with cooking

spray.",

"In a shallow dish, whisk together the egg, water, and oil. In a separate shallow dish or pie
pan, stir together the remaining ingredients except the chicken. Set the dishes and baking dish
in a row, assembly-line fashion. Dip the chicken in the egg mixture, then in the crumb mixture,
turning to coat at each step and gently shaking off any excess. Using your fingertips, gently
press the coating mixture so it adheres to the chicken. Arrange the chicken in a single layer in
the baking dish. Lightly spray the chicken with cooking spray.",

"Bake for 15–18 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the top

coating is golden brown.",

"Air Fryer Variation: Prepare the chicken as directed, through step 2. Spray the air fryer

basket with cooking spray for 2 seconds. Place the chicken in the air fryer basket. Set the
temperature to 375°F and air fry for 7 minutes. Turn the chicken pieces. Spray for 1 second with
cooking spray. Air fry for an additional 7 to 10 minutes or until the chicken is done and a meat
thermometer inserted in the center registers 165°F. Do not crowd the chicken. If your air fryer
basket is smaller, it is better to cook half of the chicken, then repeat with the remaining chicken."
